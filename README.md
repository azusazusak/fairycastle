Fairy Castle is an online booking site built in PHP. The main requirement was to create a system that allows users to search for properties and make reservations based on criteria such as dates and number of people. In addition, the administrator needed to be able to add properties and check the reservation status in the CMS. I did all the coding as well as the design and branding by myself.

## Background of Project
This was a school project to create an e-commerce website in PHP. The fictional client is an online tourism company specializing in unique accommodation rentals around the world.

## Challenges and Approaches
Initially, I analyzed the features of the three major existing hotel booking sites (Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia) and set them as benchmarks. I designed the UI/UX and information architecture by comparing sites that people are already familiar with. The most difficult part was figuring out the SQL statement to search for properties with location, property type, number of guests and dates. Since there were only simple examples on the Internet, I combined a number of them and through many trials and errors, I succeeded in completing the SQL statement.
